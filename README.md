# Build an A-Frame Game!

This project template uses Don McCurdy's [A-Frame extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras).

Check out the [A-Frame Physics documentation](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system).

## Playtime 1

Build one of the following:
* A soccer goal
* Bowling pins
* An American football field goal
* A volleyball net
* A Quidditch goal

## Playtime 2

Make an event listener that does something with the player scores a goal:
* Console log (to start)
* Use a [text component](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/primitives/a-text.html) to announce "Goal!"
* Use a [text component](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/primitives/a-text.html) and a variable to keep track of the number of goals
* Make your text (above) appear in a cool [font](https://github.com/etiennepinchon/aframe-fonts).
* Change an attribute of an element, such as a color or background
* Play a sound (create a JavaScript [audio element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement) and use the play method)
* What else can you think of?
